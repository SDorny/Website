      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I come from a family of five girls, with a mom and a dad. Though we are still a family, there have been moments where we have come too close to breaking apart. And the thing is, we couldn’t identify where we had gone wrong. We need the voices of educated professionals in this field to be much louder than they currently are. Humanity doesn’t realize how powerful the family can be. Websites that are outdated or not user-friendly have been a disservice to this cause. A simple, beautifully designed website is the key to building curiosity and trust in its resources. Let me assist in promoting this cause by supplying you with the skills necessary to lift your voices to larger audiences.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this website is aimed at people who are members of the BYU-I Child and Family Advocacy as well as those who have no idea about it. It is meant to be simple to use yet informative. Along with the homapage, there will be two subpages: one with a blog spot where people can access past videos of events and research done on them and another for individuals to contact the society.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my site to learn more about the advocacy society on campus. There will be a way to get information about events that are happening as well as access resources available, like recordings from previous events. This will not only allow the individual to see what’s happening on campus but also spark interest in those who may not be able to attend on-campus. Here are some questions that visitors to the site may ask:
        <br> 
        <br> 
        1.	What is the Child and Family Advocacy Society?
        <br> 
        2.	What is their purpose?
        <br> 
        3.	When are their events?
        <br> 
        4.	How do I learn more?
        <br>
        5.	How can I get connected?
        <br> 
        6.	What are their stances on certain topics?
        <br> 
        <br> 
This site is specifically for the BYUI Child and advocacy society, so it will be a means of getting out information about the society. This is crucial because so many of our Marriage and Family Studies students are online only. It will also have credible resources and videos from professors talking on this subject.

      </p>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is where information about what the society is and what its mission statement is. It will include a simplistic overview that will clearly and concisely demonstrate the values and goals to help promote the family and healthy relationships.
        We need a brief overview of what the purpose is, ways to get involved, and some pictures.

      </ul>
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        To be up to date on the latest events. I want them to be able to identify the time, location, and any other important details so they are fully aware of what is going to occur. Eventually, it would also have something where they could sign up for a reminder about the event!
        I need to find out when the events are happening as well as gather blurbs for them on top of specific information.

      </ul>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        The kinds of activities I want the visitors to complete on the site are mainly information-gathering at this point. I want them to be able to watch videos, read articles, and understand the basics of what they should know about hot topics occurring these days.
        I need access to old videos and select which topics will be addressed first.
